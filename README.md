Imagine Nation
=============

Scripts, core files and statics for the RunUO server Imagine Nation.
Using RunUO SVN version 836 as of 2012-02-26, although heavily modified.

I will NOT offer any support for this. If you can't compile and get it running, use google.
If you still can't get it running, then you shouldn't run a server.

Third party tools installed:
UO Architect Server

For best results, use a web server and configure all URL's and SQL files properly.
