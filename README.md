Imagine Nation
=============

Scripts and source code for the RunUO server Imagine Nation. 
Using RunUO SVN version 836 as of 2012-02-26, although heavily modified.
Statics and artwork can be downloaded from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/x6qxxoigszuzx3j/Muls.zip

To compile the source simply run compile.bat (requires .NET framework 3.5)

I will NOT offer any support for this. If you can't get it running, use google.
If you still can't get it running, then you shouldn't run a server.

Third party tools installed:
UO Architect Server

For best results, use a web server and configure all URL's and SQL files properly.
